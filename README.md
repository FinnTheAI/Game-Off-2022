# Game-Off-2022
The game is inspired by the cliche ‘Cat got your tongue’. Instead of being the hesitant human, players could play the villain role. 
As the cat, we try to stir up a row and prevent the man from speaking his minds.  Go get your claws and join our evil kitty crew!  
The game is made for Game Off 2022.
